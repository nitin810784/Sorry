                    <p class="salutation">Dear Janvi,</p>
                    
                    <p>I'm writing to you today with a heavy heart and sincere remorse. I want to start by saying how deeply sorry I am for my actions. The pain I've caused you weighs on me constantly, and I cannot express enough how guilty I feel for making you feel uncomfortable, disrespected, and let down.</p>
                    
                    <p>Looking back, I see now how my behavior crossed boundaries that should never have been crossed. What I did was wrong, and there's no excuse for it. I take full responsibility for my actions and the hurt they've caused you. I failed to consider your feelings, your boundaries, and most importantly, your trust in me.</p>
                    
                    <p class="highlight">True friendship means respect, trust, and understanding. I broke that trust, and for that, I am truly sorry.</p>
                    
                    <p>From this moment forward, I promise to always honor your boundaries, respect your space, and listen attentively to your feelings. I will never again pressure you or make you feel uncomfortable in any way. This experience has been a profound lesson for me about consent, respect, and the importance of being mindful of others' feelings.</p>
                    
                    <p>You deserve to feel safe, respected, and valued in every interaction. I failed to provide that, and I want you to know that I'm committed to changing. I'm taking time to reflect on my actions, educate myself, and grow from this experience.</p>
                    
                    <p>Our friendship means the world to me, and while I understand that forgiveness must be earned, not expected, I hope that over time I can demonstrate through my actions that I have truly changed. Whether or not you choose to forgive me, I want you to know that I will always respect your decision.</p>
                    
                    <p>Please know that I am here if you need to talk, or if there's anything I can do to make amends. If you need space, I understand and respect that too. Whatever you decide, I want only what's best for you.</p>
                    
                    <p class="closing">With sincere remorse and hope for healing,</p>
